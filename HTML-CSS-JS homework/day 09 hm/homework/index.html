    <h1 class="header">What is AI</h1>
    <h2 class="main2"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" target="_blank">AI</a>, short for Artificial Intelligence, is all about teaching machines to think and act intelligently like humans. It involves creating computer systems that can learn, reason, and solve problems on their own. From recognizing speech to driving cars and helping with medical diagnoses, AI has a wide range of uses that make our lives easier. But it also raises important questions about ethics and how we use this powerful technology.</h2>

    <h1 class="main1">Is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI</a> good or not?</h1>
    <h2 class="main3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">AI</a> is a tool with both positives and negatives. It can improve life in various ways but needs careful handling to address issues like bias and job displacement. Its impact depends on how responsibly it's developed and used.</h2>
