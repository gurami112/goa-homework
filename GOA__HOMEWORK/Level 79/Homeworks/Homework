11. Factorial Function: Write a function to compute the factorial of a non-negative integer. The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n.

12. Palindrome Checker: Implement a function to check if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

13. Anagram Checker: Create a function that takes two strings as input and returns True if they are anagrams (contain the same letters with the same frequency) and False otherwise.

14. Sentence Reversal: Create a function that takes a sentence (string) as input and returns a new string where the order of words is reversed. Ensure that punctuation marks are preserved in their original positions.

15. Simple To-Do List: Implement a function that allows users to add, remove, and view items in a to-do list. It is better to use lists or dicts for this task.

16. Combining Lists into Dictionary: Create a function that takes two lists, one for keys and one for values, and returns a dictionary where elements from the keys list are paired with elements from the values list.

17. Dictionary Key Search: Implement a function that takes a dictionary and a key as input, and returns True if the key is present in the dictionary, False otherwise.

18. Dictionary Value Aggregator: Write a function that takes a dictionary where the values are lists of numbers and returns a new dictionary where each key is associated with the sum of the numbers in its corresponding list.

19. Function to Split List by Value: Design a function that takes a list and a value as input and returns two lists: one containing all elements less than the given value, and the other containing all elements greater than or equal to the given value.

20. List Intersection Counter: Write a function that takes two lists as input and returns the count of unique elements that are common between the two lists.
